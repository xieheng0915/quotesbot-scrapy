1) Install scrapy 
2) Use scrapy shell to confirm if it's successfully installed.
3) scrapy startproject projectname
4) cd projectname
5) scrapy genspider [-t] [templatename, eg.csvFeedSpider] spidername 
   Add contents by programing
   
   
### Runing the spider, start to Ã‡rawl:
6) scrapy crawl toscrapy-css -o toscrapy-css.json etc.

```
$ scrapy list
toscrape-css
toscrape-xpath
```


I didn't upload crawling result file toscrapy-css.json and other json files, they are too large, U can just try this applications.
